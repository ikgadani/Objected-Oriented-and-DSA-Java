//23F Assignment 3 Solution: CourseList.java 
 
// Insert your solution code into this file as instructed in the information document. Hints have been provided.
// Insert your javadoc style comments to clearly and thoroughly explain your work.
// Ensure that you use the appropriate methods for the operations specifically mentioned in the instructions.
// Note that there are code inbetween the print statements (see assignment information).


//This assignment explores the use of Lists, LinkedLists, ListIterators and several more concepts learned in this course.
//The program creates two LinkedLists of Strings. 
//In order to make the code more concise, this program uses the appropriate methods and the LinkedList constructor that takes a Collection argument. 
//The elements in one list are added to the other list through a method (ensure that you use the method taught in class for this). Then the resource is released.
//Thereafter, all the Strings are converted to uppercase. 
//Subsequently, several of the courses were found unsuitable and needed to be deleted from the list. Finally, duplicates were also removed. 

//Make sure that you have detailed JAVADOC in your code using the appropriate JAVADOC style used in this course.

  // TO DO: Insert code for method calls in main here for each of the sections below.


   System.out.printf("%nDisplaying names of courses in uppercase letters...");
   

   System.out.printf("%nDeleting courses 4 to 6...");
   
   
   System.out.printf("%nHere is the current list of courses...");

// HINT: MORE TO DO: Insert your methods in this section. You should include: 


// output List contents


// locate String objects and convert to uppercase


//locate String objects and eliminate duplicates
 

// obtain sublist and use clear method to delete sublist items


 // print the list in reverse order
